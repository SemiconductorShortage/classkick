# Classkick API for Node

## IMPORTANT - Doesn't support Google Authentication!
~~This uses the Sign In functionality that Classkick provides that just uses Email/Username and Password~~
~~Signing in with Google can probably be implemented in a web version, but this is for NodeJS. Feel free to make a PR if you have a solution.~~

1.0.0 has no login mechanism! This is going to be implemented in another version, but as of right now, it only has anonymous student access!
